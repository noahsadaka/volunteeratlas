## Volunteer Atlas

Building an easy to use, central repository of volunteers willing to help deliver essential supplies to vulnerable individuals or those under self-quarantine. Very much a work in progress but it currently consisting of two parts:

1. A Google Form to help standardize collection of essential information such as the volunteerâ€™s approximate location / contact info as well as useful labels like languages spoken, mode of transportation, availability etc (https://forms.gle/WdJayiDnBFH8aNyK7)
2. An interactive map showing the approximate locations of volunteers that allows you to easily search for volunteers in any neighbourhood in Montreal and other places around the world. (https://yuorme.github.io/v4v)
